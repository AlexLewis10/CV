I'm a Junior Software Developer transitioning from a succesful stint in IT Recruitment. I am a graduate of [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) where in the space of just 16 weeks I have gone from having a basic understanding of Ruby to building complex JavaScript applications using OOP and TDD in an Agile environment.

## Projects

| Title | Description | Time | Tech | Test |
|-------|----------|-------------|------|------|------|
| [Mission-Ctrl](https://github.com/AlexLewis10/mission-ctrl) | VSCode Training Game to teach developers shortcuts to increase their productivity. As a group, we were new to the MERN stack, so there was a steep learning curve so there was a heavy focus on learning new technologies.  | 2 Weeks | React, Node, Express, MongoDB, Travis CI/CD | Jest, Enzyme |


## Skills

**Gathering Requirements**

During my time as a recruiter in the IT industry I would reguarly speak with technical hiring managers about their requirements for a vacancy. As hiring managers are incredibly busy, they rarely had time to speak at length. Therefore it was crucial that I asked pertinent questions to understand what was crucial to them. I would gain an understanding of what the aims of the projects were so I could bring someone not only with the correct technical skills but also who had experience on similar work programmes. During my time at Makers I have also recieved praise in formal reviews for conducting thorough information gathering sessions.

**Driven to Learn**

I have suceeded in an industry where the vast majority of people do not last beyond the first 6 months in the job. It is a pressurised environment in which you must adapt and learn new skills quickly.  I didn't know anything about recruitment when I started, let alone the IT industry. With sheer persistance and the willingness to learn I became one of the most consistent employees in the company.

I am currently training for my third marathon. Running a marathon is not so much about stamina as about your ability to carry on when your body is screaming for you to stop. In my second marathon I improved my previous time by over 12 minutes by learning how to optimise my training. I'm on course to hit a sub 3:30hrs time in September.

**Calming Presence**

During our final project at Makers, a time notorious for being stressful, my teammates praised me for being an equinimitous presence in the group. They mentioned on several occassions that I had read a situation that was getting tense and took steps to calm everyone down. It was as simple as suggesting the group take a break. When the meeting continued, we were able to be far more productive than we had previously been.
