I'm a Junior Software Developer transitioning from a successful stint in IT Recruitment. I am a graduate of [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) where in the space of just 16 weeks I have gone from having a basic understanding of Ruby to building complex JavaScript applications using OOP and TDD in an Agile environment.

## Skills

**Gathering Requirements**

During my time as a recruiter in the IT industry I would regularly speak with technical hiring managers about their requirements for a vacancy. As hiring managers are incredibly busy, they rarely had time to speak at length. Therefore, it was crucial that I asked pertinent questions to understand what was a priority for them. I would gain an understanding of what the aims of the projects were so I could find someone who had not only the correct technical skills but also experience on similar work programmes. During my time at Makers, I have also received praise in formal reviews for conducting thorough information-gathering sessions.

**Driven to Learn**

I have succeeded in an industry where the vast majority of people do not last beyond the first 6 months in the job. It is a pressurised environment in which you must adapt and learn new skills quickly. I didn't know anything about recruitment when I started, let alone the IT industry. With sheer persistence and the willingness to learn, I became one of the most consistent billers in the company.

I am currently training for my third marathon. Running a marathon is not so much about stamina as about your ability to persevere when your body is screaming for you to stop. In my second marathon I improved my previous time by over 12 minutes by learning to optimise my training. I'm on course to hit a sub 3:30hrs time in September.


**Calming Presence**

During our final project at Makers, a time notorious for being stressful, my teammates praised me for being an equanimitous presence in the group. They mentioned on several occasions that I had read a situation that was getting tense and took steps to calm everyone down. In one instance it was as simple as suggesting the group take a break and when that meeting continued, we were able to be far more productive.
